# Data Quality Validation

## Overview

Use this skill to design or execute data quality checks for report delivery and production acceptance. It focuses on whether data is trustworthy, not merely whether APIs return successfully.

## Inputs

- Data model, source table/API metadata, metric dictionary, API samples, production exports, SQL snippets, data files, reconciliation rules, refresh SLA, or incident examples.
- Optional: expected thresholds, source owner, refresh schedule, historical baseline, business calendar, and critical metric list.

Use `$delivery-artifact-template-management` when producing a reusable data-quality rule matrix.

## Workflow

1. Define quality scope.
   Identify critical metrics, dimensions, source tables/APIs, response fields, reporting period, data grain, and consumers.

2. Classify checks.
   Cover completeness, filter-scope completeness, uniqueness, timeliness, accuracy, validity, range/outlier, referential integrity, drift/口径漂移, cross-source consistency, and permission-sensitive data leakage.

   When the report has filters, completeness must be checked before filter linkage: option dimensions, fact rows, required fields, permission-scoped rows, default and non-default filter states, empty-state combinations, and resolver/API branches must exist at the grain needed by every affecting primary filter.

3. Write executable rules.
   For each rule, specify data object, field/metric, condition, threshold, frequency, owner, SQL/API/check expression, and failure action.

4. Compare against business expectation.
   Check totals, subtotals, TopN, rankings, period-over-period values, and cross-report numbers against source-of-truth or approved baseline.

5. Assess failures.
   Classify as blocker/high/medium/low. Distinguish source-data issue, transformation issue, API aggregation issue, frontend display issue, permission filter issue, or stale cache.

6. Define monitoring.
   For production-bound data, link quality rules to SLA alerts and `$production-observability-feedback`.

## Required Output

- Data quality scope: source objects, metrics, periods, grain, consumers.
- Rule matrix: rule ID, dimension, field/metric, expression, threshold, frequency, owner, evidence.
- Execution result: passed/failed/blocked/not run, sample records, counts, timestamps, query/API evidence.
- Trust conclusion: pass / partial / fail / blocked, with impact on report acceptance.
- Defects or blockers: likely owner, reproduction query/API, expected vs actual, retest criteria.
- Production monitoring handoff: quality rules that need scheduled checks or alerting.

## Quality Checklist

- Quality checks cover real business correctness, not only non-empty responses.
- Filter-related quality checks prove the data can support filtering before UI binding is accepted; a single default snapshot is not sufficient for affecting filters unless the component is explicitly invariant.
- Time freshness and late-arriving data rules are explicit.
- Cross-source and cross-report reconciliation is included when figures must match.
- Failures include evidence and likely owner.
- Acceptance is not marked ready when critical data-quality checks are not run.
