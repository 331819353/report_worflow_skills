# Data Model Source Mapping

## Core Positioning

Use this as a reusable artifact skill when the deliverable is a 数据模型文件 or source-to-consumer mapping that connects requirements, APIs, frontend contracts, tests, or real data sources.

This skill is not limited to the 技术方案 stage. In 技术方案 it defines the model handoff; in 数据服务 it supports API documentation and transformation design; in 前端联调 it explains how response fields map to UI expectations; in 测试校验 it provides the traceability basis for data consistency checks.

The model file must explain not only field names, but also source ownership, grain, refresh cadence, relationships, metric formulas, transformations, permissions, and what each model supports.

## Inputs

- Data-source documents with tables, views, files, APIs, fields, metadata, owner, permission, and refresh rules.
- Requirements and metric lists.
- Prototype data code, mock data, TypeScript interfaces, component data fields, filters, and response-like structures.
- API清单 or endpoint draft, if available.

## Reference Map

Read only the reference files needed for the current task:

| Need | Read |
| --- | --- |
| Produce the exact 数据模型文件 structure and required table columns | `$delivery-artifact-template-management` |
| Map physical sources into logical models and response/view models | `references/02-source-logical-response-mapping.md` |
| Define metric formulas, transformations, permissions, and data-quality rules | `references/03-metrics-transformations-quality.md` |
| Run model traceability, no-invention, and pending-item routing checks | `references/04-model-stability-gate.md` |
| Required model output, hard constraints, and final quality gate | `references/05-model-output-and-gates.md` |
| Resolve authority conflicts when requirements, metric lists, prototype code, API contracts, source documents, or tests disagree | `$quality-gate-validation` |
| Audit whether source/logical/response model design reasonably supports the business question, API inventory, frontend contract, permissions, and tests | `$quality-gate-validation` |

Loading guidance:

- For any generated or updated 数据模型文件, load the data model template from `$delivery-artifact-template-management` plus the three local references below.
- For source-to-response mapping only, use `$delivery-artifact-template-management`, `02-source-logical-response-mapping.md`, and `04-model-stability-gate.md`.
- For metric-heavy work, `03-metrics-transformations-quality.md` is mandatory.
- Before final delivery, load `05-model-output-and-gates.md`.

## Workflow

0. Check source authority.
   When multiple artifacts define the model, identify which source owns physical fields, metric formula, grain, response/view needs, permission, freshness, and sample evidence. If they conflict on source field, join, formula, enum, grain, permission, or response shape, record `ENTRY-*` findings before creating a model assumption.

1. Identify source systems.
   List every source table/view/file/API, owner, business domain, refresh cadence, access method, permission need, expected volume, and known quality issue.

2. Define source models.
   For each source, capture physical name, business meaning, grain, primary key, natural keys, partition/date fields, dimensions, measures, enums, nullable fields, and sample values.

3. Define logical/business models.
   Combine sources into business objects such as customer, order, project, inventory, contract, payment, task, alert, organization, or period. Define joins, relationship cardinality, aggregation grain, and ownership.

4. Define response/view models.
   Map prototype/API-facing fields to logical/source fields. Include display labels, field types, units, precision, numeric display contracts, enum labels, sorting, empty-state behavior, and whether the field is calculated.

4a. Preserve response contract compatibility during source replacement.
   When the source table, upstream API, fixture schema, or serving model changes, keep existing response/view field codes and behavior stable. Produce a before/after mapping: response field -> old source field/formula -> new source field/formula -> transformation/default/null rule -> verification evidence. New response fields must be additive and named by the project convention; if absent, use stable English lowerCamel field codes. Any required rename, type/unit/precision/enum/nullability/formula/grain change is a breaking `DESIGN-*` or `GAP-*` item until versioning and downstream impact are explicit.

5. Define data-version and snapshot semantics.
   When the report needs current/latest/snapshot behavior, document the snapshot role, business time field, `snapshotDate` or `latestPeriod`, `loadBatch`, `dataVersion`, source partition, report version, freshness timestamp, and invalidation/backfill rule. Clarify which response models expose version metadata, which fact/logical/precompute/snapshot models are queried or reused by each endpoint, and which source fields or partitions those params filter. If an API response is intentionally the canonical/shared snapshot for other components, model it as a named snapshot/precompute/view model with grain, fields, scope, and reuse rules instead of treating it as an incidental response.

6. Define filter-supporting data completeness.
   When consuming pages or APIs have filters, document the filter option source, fact/business row grain, required fields, default state, at least one non-default state, empty/no-permission state when relevant, and resolver/API branch dependency before declaring the response/view model filter-ready. Single default snapshots are not enough for affecting filters unless the component is explicitly invariant.

7. Define metric formulas.
   For each metric, document formula, numerator, denominator, filter scope, period logic, baseline, threshold, direction, unit, precision, numeric display contract, and reconciliation rule.

8. Define transformation notes.
   Capture date conversion, period aggregation, unit conversion, enum mapping, rounding, default fill, hierarchy rollup, deduplication, and permission filtering.

9. Mark gaps.
   Record unresolved source, field, formula, enum, join, sample, owner, refresh, or permission gaps in this skill's pending model items with stable `GAP-*` IDs, impact, owner question, current assumption, and downstream blocking status.

10. Run the design reasonableness gate.
   Check whether the model grain, joins, response/view models, metric formulas, transformation strategy, permissions, freshness, and quality rules reasonably support the consuming APIs, UI components, filters, and tests. Record unreasonable model structures as `DESIGN-*` findings.
