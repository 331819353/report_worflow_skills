# OLAP Data Modeling Optimization

## Positioning

Use this skill when performance or correctness depends on analytical data modeling rather than one query rewrite: process/grain, fact and dimension design, serving models, pre-aggregation, materialized snapshots, and metric aggregation strategy.

Use `$sql-query-optimization` for a specific SQL/query-shape problem. Use `$performance-optimization` for full API/cache/frontend/export performance diagnosis.

## Reference Loading

- Read `references/olap-data-modeling-optimization.md` before designing or accepting OLAP/report serving models.

## Anti-Laziness Gate

For non-trivial work, apply `$quality-gate-validation` `references/anti-laziness-execution-gate.md` before final output, handoff, or readiness. Do not mark the result ready while `LAZY-*` findings remain open, when available local evidence was not inspected, when owning skills were skipped, or when proof is limited to generic statements such as "checked", "optimized", "looks good", or "implemented".

## Workflow

1. Identify business process, report type, metrics, dimensions, grain, freshness, volume, and query patterns.
2. Choose serving model: raw fact + dimensions, wide table, aggregate table, materialized view, snapshot/precompute, or hybrid.
3. Define metric additivity, numerator/denominator rules, slowly changing dimensions, late-arriving data, and data-version behavior.
4. Align model with API/query-service needs: filters, sorting, TopN, drilldown, export, permission scope, and cache/precompute.
5. Define validation: row counts, reconciliation, freshness, query plans, and performance targets.

## Required Output

- OLAP model choice and rationale.
- Grain, fact/dimension/aggregate/snapshot design.
- Metric aggregation and data-version rules.
- Query/API/cache implications.
- Verification and readiness.

## Quality Gate

- Do not choose a wide table, preaggregate, or snapshot that hides metric口径, denominator, permission scope, or drilldown requirements.
- Do not mark OLAP modeling ready without grain, freshness, source authority, reconciliation, and serving-query evidence.
