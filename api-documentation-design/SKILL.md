# API Documentation Design

## Overview

Use this skill independently when the task is to turn known or inferred API intent into precise API documentation. The input can be an API inventory, backend routes, product requirements, frontend integration needs, source/data models, OpenAPI fragments, tests, or prior docs.

Do not implement backend code merely because this skill is triggered. Produce documentation that is ready for implementation, frontend integration, testing, or delivery.

## Anti-Laziness Gate

For non-trivial work, apply `$quality-gate-validation` `references/anti-laziness-execution-gate.md` before final output, handoff, or readiness. Do not mark the result ready while `LAZY-*` findings remain open, when available local evidence was not inspected, when owning skills were skipped, or when proof is limited to generic statements such as "checked", "optimized", "looks good", or "implemented".

## Core Workflow

1. Collect inputs and select the documentation mode.
   Use inventory-to-document, route-to-document, requirement-to-contract, contract-refresh, async-job, webhook/callback, streaming, or file-transfer mode based on the available artifacts.

   Use `$quality-gate-validation` when input authorities conflict or the document will drive frontend, backend, tests, or release acceptance. Check endpoint boundaries, backend reuse pattern, request/response models, auth, pagination/sorting/filter rules, SQL/index feasibility, Redis/cache decisions, pools, performance limits, and unresolved `ENTRY-*` findings before marking an endpoint ready. If Redis is named, use `$redis-cache-design-patterns` to document role, key template, TTL/invalidation, permission-safety dimensions, miss/stampede behavior, fallback, pool/timeouts, and observability.

2. Establish shared conventions.
   Define base URL, version, auth, headers, common request model groups, response envelope, errors, pagination, sorting, filters, date/time format, enum format, numeric display/precision contract, file behavior, default/max page size, global filter execution, component-internal local filter scope, Redis/cache expectations, connection-pool expectations, large-result handling, and export limits before documenting endpoint details. Redis/cache expectations must be specific enough for implementation, not a placeholder.

   When the backend follows Python/Flask SSO conventions, document the SSO headers and failure semantics in common conventions before endpoint details: `Access-Token`, optional `Application-Key` when IAMA/clientId is active, token validation owner, public-route allowlist, 401 token-invalid behavior, 403 permission-denied behavior, logout/re-login expectations, and token/log redaction rules.

   For filter-bearing endpoints, document data completeness before binding: option source, source/provider execution stage, required response fields, row grain, default request/response example, at least one non-default request/response example, empty/no-permission example when relevant, and resolver/API branch behavior. If only one default snapshot exists for an affecting filter, keep the endpoint `partial` or `blocked`.

   When the API document will drive default backend implementation, state the default backend stack as `Python + Flask + database/upstream connection pools + Redis`, including which layer owns routing, pool configuration, Redis cache/precompute, timeout/fallback, and observability. Use another stack only with a user/existing-project override reason.

   Define response-field compatibility conventions before endpoint details. Existing response field names, nesting, types, units, precision, enum meanings, nullability, formulas, grain, numeric display semantics, and empty/no-permission behavior are stable across source/table/upstream replacement. New fields are additive by default and must follow the project naming convention; if no convention exists, use stable English lowerCamel field codes. Breaking changes require versioning, deprecation/migration notes, and downstream impact.

   For metric-bearing response fields, apply `$metric-number-display-contract` before examples: value type, raw unit, display unit, display scale, screen precision, tooltip precision, export precision, rounding mode, null display, true-zero display, denominator-zero behavior, negative-zero handling, small-nonzero behavior when relevant, formula precision policy, and formatter owner. Percent/rate fields must state whether the payload is raw `0-1`, numeric percent `0-100`, or display string; formatted-only values are not sufficient when consumers need sorting, filtering, thresholds, exports, or localization.

   For snapshot/latest-period reports, document the snapshot role and shared data-version context before endpoint details: `snapshotDate`, `latestPeriod`, `loadBatch`, `dataVersion`, report version, or source version. Related data-bearing endpoints must consume that context through request params, backend-defaulted params, backend-injected scope, or an explicitly declared canonical/shared snapshot dataset before querying or deriving results, and include it in source/provider predicates, precompute lookups, and cache keys. A snapshot/dashboard aggregate endpoint may be reused by metrics, trends, rankings, tables, drilldowns, or exports only when the document states the matching grain, filters, permission scope, fields, cache key, and invalidation behavior.

3. Document endpoint behavior.
   For each endpoint, capture purpose, trigger, method/path, auth, request params/body, response schema, examples, errors, pagination/performance limits, source mode, compatibility notes, and status.

4. Trace dependencies.
   Link response fields to models, routes, repositories, source systems, upstream APIs, formulas, or explicit pending items. Avoid silently inventing fields or business rules.

5. Expose unresolved items.
   Mark partial or blocked endpoint behavior when source fields, formulas, auth values, permissions, samples, or performance decisions are missing.

6. Prepare handoff.
   Include enough examples and edge states for frontend contract validation, backend implementation, integration tests, runtime QA, and delivery review.

7. Mark production readiness when the API document is production-bound.
   Apply `$quality-gate-validation` before calling the API document production-ready. API documentation is only `partial` when authoritative source, auth/permission, environment/base URL, health/runtime evidence, observability, performance/export limits, version compatibility, or testing handoff is missing.
