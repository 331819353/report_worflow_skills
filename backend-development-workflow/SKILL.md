# Backend Development Workflow

## Positioning

Use this workflow for the backend/data-service stage: convert a technical solution, API inventory, data model, or source mapping into a backend design, API documentation, implementation plan, or runnable backend service when explicitly requested.

It owns data-service runtime boundaries, route/service/query layering, contracts, transformation adapters, pools/cache/precompute, permissions, logging/observability, environment, deployment, and backend readiness.

## Reference Files

- `references/data-service-design-template.md` for backend/data-service design output.
- `references/api-document-template.md` for API documentation.
- `references/report-data-service-backend-implementation.md` for implementation details.
- `references/missing-info-template.md` for blocked or partial backend handoff.
- `references/backend-development-gates.md` for detailed constraints, required outputs, and readiness blockers.
- `$quality-gate-validation` `references/preflight-understanding-gate.md` before backend design, API docs, implementation, repair, or readiness.

## Data-Service Architecture Scope

Decide endpoint families, request context, response envelope, service/query/source-adapter layers, transformation boundaries, data-version/snapshot role, filters/pagination/sorting/export scope, permission injection, pool/cache/precompute strategy, error model, logging, health/status endpoints, deployment, and rollback.

## Workflow

1. Run the Preflight understanding gate before backend design, API docs, implementation, or repair. Name the requested stage, evidence inventory, source/API/model/frontend authority order, affected contracts, owning skills, missing evidence, and start decision.
2. Inventory technical solution, API inventory, model/source mapping, metric口径, numeric display/precision contracts, permissions, SSO/token header contract, database role map, env/auth, and existing code. Use `$metric-number-display-contract` for numeric semantics and `$environment-profile-contract` for test/production runtime profiles when in scope.
3. Run quality gates when source/API/model/frontend expectations conflict.
4. Run the anti-laziness execution gate from `$quality-gate-validation` for implementation, repair, documentation, or acceptance steps. Keep `LAZY-*` findings visible until evidence closes them.
5. Define data-service design: boundaries, layers, request context, response model, numeric metadata contract, data-version contract, permission scope, SSO/auth flow, database ownership, cache/precompute, and observability. Load `$python-flask-sso-multidatabase-backend` when Python/Flask SSO or multi-database structure is in scope; load `$java-springboot-backend-development` when Java/Spring Boot structure, Spring Security/JWT/SSO, Maven/Docker, or Profile conventions are in scope.
6. Produce or update API documentation through `$api-documentation-design`.
7. Validate contracts against frontend expectations, source samples, OpenAPI, mocks, routes, and runtime responses.
8. Design transformation adapters for source-to-response and response-to-view-model compatibility.
9. If implementation is requested, edit backend code with `$code-change-ledger-management` discipline and preserve existing project patterns.
10. Configure pools, Redis/cache, timeouts, errors, logging, health checks, and env profiles. Use `$redis-cache-design-patterns` when Redis is named and `$environment-profile-contract` when handoff profiles matter.
11. Run available tests/build/startup and `$runtime-url-smoke-test` when a URL is produced.
12. Produce backend handoff notes, gaps, readiness, and version links.

## Required Output

- Preflight understanding matrix and backend/data-service design or implemented service summary.
- API documentation/contract status.
- Python/Flask SSO and multi-database architecture when applicable: app factory, route/service/repository/db layers, token validation, 401/403, database role map, env vars, and pool ownership.
- Java/Spring Boot architecture when applicable: controller/service/mapper-or-repository layering, `ApiResponse<T>`, global exception handling, Spring Security/JWT/SSO, IAM/IAMA or local JWT bridge, Profile YAML, Maven/Gradle, Docker, and startup commands.
- Source/model/adapter mapping and response compatibility notes.
- Numeric precision/display contract: value type, raw/display unit, scale, precision, tooltip/export precision, rounding, null/zero/denominator-zero, and data-vs-presentation ownership.
- Runtime model: pools, Redis/cache/precompute, timeout/fallback, export/async behavior, env/auth, health, logging, observability.
- Code-ledger proof when backend source changed.
- Anti-laziness execution result: local evidence inspected, `LAZY-*` findings or explicit no-finding result, before/after proof for repairs, regression probe, and readiness impact.
- Verification commands, URL/smoke result, blockers, and readiness.

## Quality Gate

- Do not implement routes from UI fields alone; trace endpoints to source/model/metric/permission contracts.
- Do not implement or document backend behavior before a Preflight understanding decision identifies source authority, API/model/frontend contracts, runtime target, and blockers.
- Existing API response fields are stable across source/table/upstream replacement unless a versioned breaking change is documented.
- Existing numeric response semantics are stable across source/table/upstream replacement: type, raw unit, display unit, scale, precision, formula, nullability, denominator-zero behavior, and export precision cannot drift without a versioned change.
- Python/Flask SSO + multi-database backends must separate API, service, repository, db engine/session, middleware, schema, and SQL-file responsibilities; do not place complex SQL, token validation, permission checks, and response formatting all inside route handlers.
- Java/Spring Boot backends must keep controllers thin, place transactions in service implementations, separate DTO/Entity/VO, define global exception handling, and keep JWT/SSO/Security behavior out of business controllers.
- SSO readiness requires backend token validation, clear `Access-Token`/optional `Application-Key` header contract, distinct 401 and 403 behavior, local user/role/permission mapping, and token/log redaction.
- Data-bearing endpoints must use request/defaulted version params, backend-injected permission/data scope, source predicates or cache/precompute keys; echoing metadata is not enough.
- Backend/data-service readiness needs diagnosable structured logs, connection release on errors/timeouts, env separation, and runtime verification.
- Do not mark backend work ready when the anti-laziness gate is missing, `LAZY-*` findings remain open, or the conclusion uses generic "checked/done/optimized" wording without concrete evidence.
- Load `backend-development-gates.md` before implementing, documenting, or accepting backend/data-service work.
