# Performance Optimization

## Positioning

Use this skill to design, review, or repair performance-sensitive behavior across data services, SQL/OLAP, APIs, frontend data loading, charts, tables, exports, and runtime rendering.

It owns performance strategy and verification. It does not replace API design, data modeling, frontend implementation, or testing workflows.

## Reference Loading

- Data service resilience, cache, pagination, pooling, and capacity: `references/data-service-performance-resilience-contract.md`
- Redis cache, lock, rate-limit, job-state, and hot-query usage patterns: `$redis-cache-design-patterns`
- SQL query writing, execution shape, and index-friendly filters: `$sql-query-optimization`
- OLAP modeling and analytical aggregation: `$olap-data-modeling-optimization`

## Anti-Laziness Gate

For non-trivial work, apply `$quality-gate-validation` `references/anti-laziness-execution-gate.md` before final output, handoff, or readiness. Do not mark the result ready while `LAZY-*` findings remain open, when available local evidence was not inspected, when owning skills were skipped, or when proof is limited to generic statements such as "checked", "optimized", "looks good", or "implemented".

## Workflow

1. Identify the performance surface: SQL/source, API, backend service, cache, export, frontend fetch/adaptation, chart/table rendering, or deployment runtime.
2. Define performance target: latency, throughput, first screen, interaction time, export time, row count, concurrency, freshness, or memory budget.
3. Locate current bottleneck evidence: query plan, network waterfall, API logs, browser performance trace, data volume, component count, or user report.
4. Select the data-service performance pattern before using Redis or async work: source-side query optimization, precompute/materialized snapshot, Redis cache, stale fallback, request coalescing, rate/concurrency limit, async job, or frontend rendering optimization.
5. Apply the smallest appropriate optimization: query/index/range rewrite, pagination/keyset, aggregation pushdown, cache, connection pool, request batching, lazy loading, virtualization, chart sampling, memoization, or worker/off-main-thread processing.
6. Define verification commands, metrics, before/after evidence, and residual risk.

## Required Output

- Performance surface and target.
- Bottleneck evidence and hypothesis.
- Optimization plan or implemented changes.
- Redis/cache/precompute decision when relevant: key template, TTL/invalidation, permission-safety dimensions, stampede protection, fallback, and observability.
- Risks around correctness, freshness, permission scope, cache invalidation, and export completeness.
- Verification result or blocker.

## Quality Gate

- Do not optimize by changing metric口径, permission scope, or business totals.
- Do not fetch broad result sets and filter/sort/page globally in memory for database-backed data.
- Do not optimize request count by making one data API a hidden runtime source for another. Snapshot/dashboard aggregate APIs, metrics, trends, tables, and exports may share `snapshotDate/latestPeriod/loadBatch/dataVersion`, cache invalidation, and a declared canonical/shared snapshot; undocumented endpoint-payload reuse is the risk, not explicit snapshot reuse.
- Do not optimize by removing or ignoring backend query params. Data-version, business filters, pagination/sort, and permission/data scope must remain source-side predicates, precompute lookup inputs, or cache-key dimensions.
- Cache keys must include filters, permission/user/tenant scope, source version, pagination/sort, and locale/unit options when relevant.
- Redis usage is not ready when key dimensions, TTL/invalidation, permission safety, miss/stampede behavior, fallback, pool/timeouts, and observability are unknown.
- Database/upstream connection-pool usage is not ready when any query path can raise `ApiError`, timeout, cancellation, validation error after acquire, early return, or generic exception without releasing/closing the acquired connection in `finally`, context-manager cleanup, or an equivalent pool-safe guard. A leaked StarRocks connection can exhaust a small pool such as `STARROCKS_POOL_MAX=5`; treat this as a blocker, not a minor resilience issue.
- Frontend rendering optimizations must preserve loading, empty, error, and interaction states.
