# Haier IAMA Backend Integration Entrypoints

Use this reference to choose the correct backend SSO entrypoint before implementing. Backend access is not one single path: projects may use the official Java SDK, direct IAMA API calls, a local session/JWT bridge, or a gateway/middleware-only retrofit.

## Entrypoint Map

| Entrypoint | Use When | Primary Modules | Required Flow |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Java SDK integration | Spring Boot/Spring backend can use `iam-auth-sdk-starter`; official SDK dependency is acceptable | controller, SDK config, auth service, middleware | Configure SDK, expose `tokenUrl`, exchange code with SDK, map user, protect APIs, return 401/403 correctly. |
| Direct backend API integration | Non-Java backend, SDK unavailable, or team wants explicit HTTP calls | IAMA client/gateway, token controller, auth middleware | Call `/api/oauth/code/get/v2`, call `/api/oauth/token/check`, normalize errors, protect APIs. |
| Local session/JWT bridge | Existing app already has local session/JWT/permission model | token service, user mapper, session/JWT issuer, middleware | Exchange IAMA token, map account to local user, issue local context, still document whether IAMA token check remains required. |
| Gateway or middleware retrofit | Login works but protected API validation is missing or inconsistent | middleware/filter/interceptor, public allowlist, request context | Read headers, validate client ID, call token check, attach user context, enforce 401/403 boundary. |
| Multi-client or tenant-aware backend | More than one frontend client ID or tenant can call the backend | client registry, secret resolver, auth gateway | Validate `Application-Key`, resolve only configured credentials, avoid arbitrary browser-driven credential selection. |

## Shared Backend Contract

Every entrypoint must satisfy these rules:

- `clientSecret` is server-side only.
- The frontend `tokenUrl` points to a business backend endpoint, not directly to IAMA with browser credentials.
- Protected browser requests carry `Application-Key: {clientId}` and `Access-Token: {token}`.
- Backend rejects missing or unknown `Application-Key` values before calling IAMA.
- Backend calls IAMA token check with the same client ID and token.
- Token is valid only when `resultCode == "0"` and `data == true`.
- Missing, expired, invalid, malformed, or unverifiable auth returns 401 or the service's normalized token-invalid response.
- 403 is reserved for valid-token users who lack business permission.
- Public routes and health checks must be explicitly allowlisted.

## Java SDK Integration Flow

Use this when the backend is Spring Boot 2.0+ or compatible Spring and can use the official SDK dependency.

1. Add the SDK dependency.

   ```xml
   <dependency>
     <groupId>com.haier</groupId>
     <artifactId>iam-auth-sdk-starter</artifactId>
     <version>1.1.7</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

2. Configure SDK properties.

   ```yaml
   iam:
     auth:
       sdk:
         config:
           authHost: https://iam-test.haier.net/api
           clientId: your-client-id
           clientSecret: your-client-secret
   ```

3. Expose the frontend `tokenUrl`.
   Provide a backend endpoint such as `/getTokenAndUserInfo` or the project's standard auth route. It accepts `code` from the frontend SDK and never accepts `clientSecret` from the browser.

4. Exchange code through the SDK.
   Call the SDK service method to exchange authorization code for token and user info. Treat non-success SDK responses as auth failures.

5. Preserve and normalize response fields.
   Preserve upstream token fields such as access token, expiry, refresh token, and account. Return only the safe response shape required by the frontend.

6. Map account to local user.
   Bind IAMA account fields to local user, role, org, and permission context.

7. Protect business APIs.
   Add middleware/filter/interceptor so protected routes read `Application-Key` and `Access-Token`, validate client ID, and verify token validity. If the SDK does not cover request-time token validation, call the IAMA token-check API through a small gateway.

8. Return correct status.
   Return 401/token-invalid for invalid auth and 403 for valid-token permission denial.

9. Test SDK and middleware boundaries.
   Cover successful code exchange, failed exchange, missing code, missing headers, invalid token, no permission, and public allowlist behavior.

## Direct Backend API Integration Flow

Use this for Python, Node, Go, .NET, custom Java, or any backend where the Java SDK is unavailable or not desired.

1. Create one IAMA HTTP gateway.
   Encapsulate remote base URL, timeouts, retry policy, client ID, client secret, and response normalization.

2. Implement code exchange.
   Call:

   ```http
   POST {baseUrl}/api/oauth/code/get/v2
   Content-Type: application/json
   ```

   Request body:

   ```json
   {
     "client_id": "your-client-id",
     "client_secret": "server-side-secret",
     "code": "frontend-code"
   }
   ```

3. Validate exchange success.
   Treat success as `resultCode == "0"` plus present `data.access_token`. Fail closed on missing token, malformed response, timeout, or upstream error.

4. Implement token check.
   Call:

   ```http
   GET {baseUrl}/api/oauth/token/check?client_id={clientId}
   Application-Key: {clientId}
   Access-Token: {accessToken}
   ```

5. Validate token check success.
   Treat valid as `resultCode == "0" && data == true`. Any other response is unauthenticated.

6. Protect routes through middleware.
   Read headers from every protected request, validate allowed client ID, call token check, attach user context, and continue to business logic only after success.

7. Normalize errors.
   Convert upstream failures to the service's unauthenticated/upstream-auth-failed error types. Redact tokens, codes, secrets, and full account payloads from logs and responses.

8. Test failure modes.
   Include missing headers, unknown client ID, invalid token, upstream timeout, malformed response, and route allowlist mistakes.

## Local Session Or JWT Bridge Flow

Use this when the backend already has local login, sessions, JWTs, or a mature permission model.

1. Exchange the frontend code through SDK or direct API.
2. Map IAMA account to local user by stable identifiers such as account id, `userName`, `account`, `domain`, or `tenantId`.
3. Load local roles, organizations, data scopes, and feature permissions.
4. Issue the existing local session or JWT if the product contract requires it.
5. Document whether later browser requests must still include IAMA `Application-Key` and `Access-Token`.
6. If local session replaces repeated IAMA token checks, document the explicit product/security decision and expiry policy.
7. Keep 401/403 behavior aligned: invalid session or invalid token is 401; valid identity without permission is 403.
8. Align logout so SDK logout and local session invalidation do not leave stale state.

## Gateway Or Middleware Retrofit Flow

Use this when code exchange already works but protected business APIs are weak, inconsistent, or missing auth checks.

1. Inventory protected and public routes.
2. Add a small public allowlist for health checks, static assets, login/tokenUrl, and preflight when needed.
3. For every other business API, require `Application-Key` and `Access-Token`.
4. Validate `Application-Key` against configuration.
5. Call IAMA `token/check`.
6. Attach local user context only after token validity is confirmed.
7. Return 401/token-invalid for auth failure.
8. Return 403 only after local permission checks fail for a valid token.
9. Add tests proving business routes cannot bypass the middleware.

## Multi-Client Or Tenant-Aware Flow

Use this when multiple frontend client IDs or tenants call the same backend.

1. Build an explicit client registry with allowed `Application-Key` values.
2. Resolve client secrets only from server-side configuration or secret storage.
3. Reject unknown `Application-Key` values before upstream calls.
4. Never let arbitrary browser-provided client IDs select credentials dynamically.
5. Bind client ID to tenant, redirect/origin allowlist, and permission scope when needed.
6. Test known client, unknown client, mismatched token/client ID, and disabled client scenarios.
