# API Contract Validation

## Positioning

Use this skill to compare API contracts across producer and consumer evidence. It is side-neutral: apply it before backend implementation, before frontend mock replacement, after route changes, or during integration debugging.

It validates behavior and records differences. It does not design a new API inventory, write full API documentation, or implement backend/frontend code unless another workflow asks for that.

## Reference Loading

- Backend/source authority and runtime validation: `references/backend-contract-sources-and-authority.md`, `references/backend-response-and-request-validation.md`, `references/backend-runtime-source-validation.md`
- Backend validation note: `references/backend-validation-note-template.md`
- Frontend provider evidence and comparison checklist: `references/frontend-source-contract-types.md`, `references/frontend-comparison-checklist.md`
- Frontend contract note: `references/frontend-contract-note-template.md`
- Cross-artifact conflicts or readiness gates: use `$quality-gate-validation`.

## Workflow

1. List all contract evidence: API docs, OpenAPI, route code, frontend clients, mock data, provider samples, DB/upstream samples, runtime responses, env/auth notes, and test failures.
2. Decide authority order. If sources conflict on behavior, run `$quality-gate-validation` before changing affected contracts.
3. Compare request contract: method/path, params, filters, pagination, sorting, headers, auth, defaults, invalid values, and permission scope.
4. Compare filter data completeness before binding readiness.
   For every filter/search/sort/page param that should change business data, verify option data, matching source/provider rows, required response fields, default sample, at least one non-default sample, empty/no-permission sample when relevant, and resolver/API branch coverage. If this evidence is missing, classify the contract as data-completeness or data-grain `missing/blocked` before judging frontend binding.
5. Compare data-version, snapshot role, and endpoint dependency contract.
   For snapshot/latest-period API groups, verify `snapshotDate`, `latestPeriod`, `loadBatch`, `dataVersion`, report version, or source version is exposed/defaulted consistently and included in request/query/cache context where needed. Verify business filters and permission/data scope are applied as backend params, source/provider predicates, precompute lookup keys, declared snapshot reuse rules, or Redis/cache key segments before response construction. Confirm metrics, trends, rankings, tables, drilldowns, and exports either validly reuse a declared canonical/shared snapshot or avoid dependency on undocumented snapshot responses, frontend call order, or controller-memory snapshots.
6. Compare response contract: envelope, fields, nesting, types, units, precision, numeric display contract, enum values, dates, totals, empty states, errors, and no-permission states. For rate/percentage fields, identify whether the API returns a raw ratio (`0.744`), percent number (`74.4`), or display-ready string (`74.4%`), and record display owner and rounding rules.
   For every metric-bearing field, validate value type, raw/display unit, display scale, screen precision, tooltip/export precision, rounding mode, null/zero/denominator-zero behavior, negative-zero handling, small-nonzero behavior when relevant, formula precision policy, and formatter ownership across docs, mocks, route/runtime samples, source samples, frontend adapters, and exports.
6a. When a backend source table/upstream/fixture has changed, compare old and new runtime or fixture responses against the same API contract. Existing fields must remain present and behavior-compatible; newly added fields must be additive, conventionally named, documented, and safe for consumers to ignore.
7. Compare runtime/source behavior when available: mock vs fixture vs DB/upstream vs live API.
8. Classify each finding as pass, mismatch, missing, ambiguous, blocked, or not tested.

## Required Output

- Contract evidence inventory and authority decision.
- Field/request/state comparison matrix.
- Numeric display/precision comparison matrix for metric-bearing fields.
- Source/table replacement compatibility result when applicable: preserved fields, changed fields, additive fields, missing mapping, and version/deprecation need.
- Filter data-completeness result before binding readiness.
- Parameter-driven data-version, snapshot role/reuse, scope-filtering, and endpoint-dependency result when snapshot/latest-period semantics exist.
- Findings with severity, expected, actual, evidence, owner side, and suggested repair.
- Readiness: `ready`, `partial`, or `blocked`.
- Handoff notes for API docs, backend, frontend, or testing.

## Quality Gate

- Do not mark pass when required evidence is absent.
- Do not silently merge contradictory API docs, mocks, route code, and runtime samples.
- Every mismatch includes field/path/state, expected value, actual value, and evidence source.
- Source/table replacement validation is not ready when existing response fields are renamed, removed, moved, type-shifted, unit/precision/enum/nullable-shifted, formula-shifted, or grain-shifted without an approved versioned breaking change and downstream migration plan.
- New response fields are not ready when naming, source trace, type, unit, nullability, permission/sensitivity, or additive compatibility status is missing.
- Frontend-facing readiness includes loading, empty, error, auth, no-permission, and partial data states.
- Frontend-facing rate/change/completion contracts are not ready until raw value scale, display scale/unit, rounding, and owner are explicit. Visible Chinese report labels should use `%` unless the contract explicitly and intentionally requires `pt`, `p.p.`, or `percentage point`.
- Metric-bearing contracts are not ready when KPI/chart/table/tooltip/drawer/export use inconsistent units, scales, decimals, rounding, null/zero/denominator-zero handling, or when numeric logic depends on rounded display strings instead of raw numeric values and numerator/denominator recomputation.
- Filter/search/sort/page params are not ready until data completeness is proven before binding: option values, source/provider rows, required fields, default/non-default runtime or fixture samples, and resolver/API branches exist or are marked blocked.
- Filter/search/sort/page params are not ready when the contract only changes UI selected state or omits the provider/resolver fields needed to rebuild the response for non-default states.
- Snapshot/latest-period API groups are not ready when shared data-version fields are missing, snapshot reuse is undocumented, or one data-bearing endpoint consumes another endpoint's runtime payload instead of a declared snapshot/source/logical/precompute/cache contract.
- Data-bearing APIs are not ready when changing `snapshotDate/dataVersion/loadBatch`, business filters, or permission/data scope does not change the backend query/cache key or verified result scope as expected.
