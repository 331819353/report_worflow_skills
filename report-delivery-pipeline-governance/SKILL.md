# Report Delivery Pipeline Governance

## Positioning

Use this skill to keep report delivery stages aligned and to decide whether a handoff can proceed across requirement, prototype, data model, API, backend, frontend, testing, release, defect repair, and production feedback.

Use `$delivery-version-management` for version indexes and release bundles. Use `$quality-gate-validation` for concrete gate findings when checking a specific artifact or implementation.

## Reference Loading

- Read `references/report-delivery-pipeline-contract.md` before judging cross-stage handoff completeness, stage routing, or delivery-chain readiness.
- Use `$artifact-readability-standard` when the handoff artifact needs dual-readable structure.
- Use `$environment-profile-contract` for runtime profile readiness.
- Use `$code-change-ledger-management` when source code changed.

## Anti-Laziness Gate

For non-trivial work, apply `$quality-gate-validation` `references/anti-laziness-execution-gate.md` before final output, handoff, or readiness. Do not mark the result ready while `LAZY-*` findings remain open, when available local evidence was not inspected, when owning skills were skipped, or when proof is limited to generic statements such as "checked", "optimized", "looks good", or "implemented".

## Workflow

1. Identify current stage, upstream artifacts, downstream consumers, and claimed readiness.
2. Map the stage to required handoff artifacts and owning skills.
3. Check that stable IDs, versions, sources, gaps, evidence, and readiness values link across stages.
4. Route missing or conflicting work to the owning skill instead of absorbing implementation details.
5. Return a stage verdict and next-stage entry criteria.

## Required Output

- Current stage and target next stage.
- Required upstream/downstream artifacts and missing pieces.
- Owning skill routing for each gap or blocker.
- Readiness: `ready`, `partial`, or `blocked`.
- Next-stage handoff requirements.

## Quality Gate

- Do not mark a stage ready when required upstream contracts, evidence, versions, profile decisions, code ledgers, or test results are missing.
- Do not let a later-stage implementation silently redefine requirement, metric, API, source, permission, or test contracts.
