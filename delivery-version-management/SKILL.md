# Delivery Version Management

## Overview

Use this skill to create a single delivery index that links prototype, requirements, API docs, data models, backend, frontend, test reports, automation, defects, and release notes across iterations. Use `$code-change-ledger-management` for reusable file-level code change ledger discipline on frontend, backend, and runnable prototype source code.

The goal is to answer: "Which version of each artifact belongs together, and what changed?"

## Inputs

- Artifact folders/files, current version naming, PRD/prototype/API/model/frontend/backend/test documents, release notes, branch/commit, environment, or defect reports.
- Optional: target version, release date, owner, status, dependency chain, and change request IDs.
- Frontend/backend/prototype source code paths when the delivery index must link to per-file ledgers, changed code ranges, or implementation traceability.

Use `$delivery-artifact-template-management` when producing the delivery index table. Use `scripts/build_delivery_index.py` to create a first-pass index from files.
Use `$code-change-ledger-management` when source code is created, edited, repaired, or refactored.

## Workflow

1. Define version chain.
   Use a stable chain such as `requirement-v1 -> prototype-v1 -> model-v1 -> api-v1 -> backend-v1 -> frontend-v1 -> test-v1 -> release-v1`. Keep patch/minor versions when one artifact updates without full-cycle redesign.

2. Inventory artifacts.
   List every artifact path, type, version, owner, source date, status, and related change IDs. Mark missing or stale artifacts.

3. Link dependencies.
   Connect each artifact to upstream/downstream versions. For example, `frontend-v2` consumes `api-v2` and is validated by `test-v2`.

4. Record compatibility.
   Mark compatible, partial, breaking, deprecated, or blocked. Breaking changes must route to `$change-impact-analysis`.

5. Define release bundle.
   State exactly which artifacts belong in the current delivery package and which remain draft/obsolete.

6. Maintain index.
   Update the index after every approved change, test result, defect repair, or release. Do not overwrite history; append a new version row.

7. Link code file ledgers when code changes.
   For every scoped frontend/backend/prototype code file, apply `$code-change-ledger-management`, then link the sidecar ledger status and changed ranges in the delivery index.

## Script

Create a first-pass Markdown index:

```bash
python3 delivery-version-management/scripts/build_delivery_index.py <artifact-root> --out DELIVERY_INDEX.md
```

Use `--version release-v1` to stamp a target bundle version.

Create or append a per-code-file ledger:

```bash
python3 delivery-version-management/scripts/update_code_change_ledger.py --file <code-file> --stage before
python3 delivery-version-management/scripts/update_code_change_ledger.py --file <code-file> --stage after --summary "<change summary>" --ranges "L10-L42"
```

## Required Output

- Version chain: requirement/prototype/model/API/backend/frontend/test/release mapping.
- Delivery artifact index: artifact type, name, version, path, owner, status, upstream/downstream versions, change IDs, evidence.
- Code file change ledger status when code changed: changed code file, sidecar ledger path, pre-change read evidence, appended version, changed code ranges, verification, and unresolved follow-up.
- Compatibility and freshness check: stale, missing, obsolete, breaking, partial, or ready.
- Release bundle: included artifacts, excluded drafts, required approvals, rollout/rollback notes.
- Follow-up actions: missing versions, required updates, owner workflows, and blockers.

## Quality Checklist

- Every delivery artifact has type, version, path/source, owner, and status.
- Version relationships are explicit and not inferred silently.
- Test reports and automation runs point to the exact frontend/backend/API versions tested.
- Obsolete documents are marked obsolete rather than left ambiguous.
- Breaking or mismatched versions route to `$change-impact-analysis`.
- Frontend, backend, and runnable prototype code changes are not version-complete unless every changed scoped code file has a sidecar ledger that was read before edit and appended after edit with feature/code-range/version/verification information.
